.Канон:

The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches

born to those who have thrice defied him,

born as the seventh month dies

and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal

but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not

and either must die at the hand of the other

for neither can live while the other survives

.Переклад канону:

Наближається той, хто зможе перемогти Темного Лорда

народжений наприкінці сьомого місяця тими, хто тричі кидав йому виклик...
__(змінено через те, що має нормально звучати версія, ніби це про
братів Певерел 102:17579)__

і Темний Лорд позначить його як рівного собі,

але він володітиме силою, недоступною Темному Лордові...
__(змінено через довгі описи про те, що knows not -- це не просто
те, що він не може використати/не знає, а щось дуже незбагненне для
нього 086:15252)__

і хтось один загине від руки іншого, бо разом їм жити не судилося...

__THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES,__

Наближається той, хто зможе перемогти Темного Лорда

28:5930
__BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,__

народжений в родині тих, хто тричі кидав йому виклик,

28:5931
__BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,__

народжений наприкінці сьомого місяця,

28:5932
__AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,__

і Темний Лорд позначить його як рівного собі,

28:5933
__BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,__

але він володітиме силою, якої Темний Лорд не відає...

28:5934
__AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,__

і хтось один знищить все, крім залишку іншого,

28:5935
__FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD.__

бо разом ці два різних духи не можуть існувати в одному світі.

“...Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose a man were carrying a knife, and
he tripped over a baby and stabbed himself. Would you say that the baby had,”
Snape’s voice lowered, as though he were imitating some still deeper voice,
“__THE POWER TO VANQUISH__ him?”

76:13431
“Um… no?” she said hesitantly.

76:13432
“Then what __does__ it mean to have the power to vanquish someone?”

76:13433
“It means you’ve got the
__power__, but you don’t __have__ to do it. It means you could do it
if you tried -”

76:13434
“Choice. There will be a choice. That is what the
riddle seems to imply. And that choice is not a foregone conclusion to the
chooser, for the riddle does not say, __will vanquish,__ but rather
__the power to vanquish.__ How would a grown man mark a baby as his
equal?”

76:13435
“What?” said Rianne. She didn’t understand that at all.

76:13436
“__Marking__ a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would produce a
lasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What mark would signify that a
baby was your __equal?__”

76:13437
She answered with the first thought that came to mind. “If you signed a
betrothal contract, that would mean you’d be equals with them someday, when
they grew up and you got married.”

76:13438
“That… That’s probably not it, Miss Felthorne, but thank you for
trying. ...
Power he knows not… it __must__ be more than some unknown spell. Not
something __he__ could acquire simply by practice and study. Some innate
talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus… and yet that hardly seems like
a power he __knows not__. Nor can I see how __either__ could destroy
all but a remnant of the other; I can see it in one direction, but not the
reverse…

76:13442
And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, “__FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT
SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD.__”

76:13443
“Those two different ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?”

76:13444
“But why__ not__, Miss Felthorne? What is the __meaning__ of a
statement like that? What are we really being told?”

76:13445
“Ah…” she hazarded. “If the two ingredients mix, they’ll catch fire and burn
the cauldron?”

“Let’s see…” Harry said. “I’m male and born on July 31st, check. I did in fact
vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous pronoun in line two… but I wasn’t born
yet so it’s hard to see how my parents could have thrice defied __me.__
This scar is an obvious candidate for the mark…” Harry touched his forehead.
“Then there’s the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably refers to my
scientific background -”

086:15252
Severus’s eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration. “The Dark Lord
could obtain that power by studying the same books as you, Potter. But the
prophecy did not say, __power the Dark Lord has not.__ Nor even,
__power the Dark Lord cannot have.__ She spoke of __power the Dark
Lord knows not__… it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.
Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seen it…”

102:17579
__Born to those who have thrice defied him __seemed to strongly invoke the
Peverell brothers and the three Deathly Hallows - though Harry didn’t exactly
see how Death could have marked him as an equal, which seemed to imply some
sort of deliberate action on Death’s part.

“I think the power that Voldemort knew not… was that I had something to protect.”
